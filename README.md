# Exploring_Migration_Data

The increase in globalization and crisis across the world has brought about increase in migration across the world. Migrants often die or go missing in their endeavor, and this has been a major concern of the entire world. With that in mind, we built a project to understand the gravity of the problem. We wanted to understand where migrants go missing and how has the United States responded to immigration across the years. The United States has had varying stances on immigration in different presidential terms, so we wanted to see if there was any significant change in responses.

For our study, we retrieved data from two main sources. The first source was the missing migrant data from the [International Organization for Migration](https://missingmigrants.iom.int/downloads) and the second was the immigration statistics from the [Office of Homeland Security Statistics (OHSS)](https://ohss.dhs.gov/topics/immigration/yearbook-immigration-statistics/yearbook-2023), the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. We then cleaned the excel files in order to conduct our analysis.

Our project serves to explore the following questions:

How do migrant missings and deaths differ based on region, place of origin, and route
How do the causes of migrant death differ by region, place of origin, and route?
Where do migrants often go missing? How does that look with regard to the United States?
Did missing migrant trends look different in the US during the first Trump administration?
How did this compare to the rest of the world during that administration?
How have the immigration trends in the US varied across the years?
How have immigration trends changed across the last 3 administrations?
Is there a correlation between amnesty granted by the United States and number of expulsions and apprehensions?
Is there a correlation between amnesty granted by the United States and the number of migrants going missing en route to the US?
Do immigration trends and missing migrant numbers change during global crisis? For reference, we used Global Economic Crisis of 2007-09 and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Importing Libraries
We have use pandas for data cleaning and analysis. For visualization, we are using seaborn, matplotlib and plotly. For statistical testing, we will be using stats from scipy library.
